# Elevator Pitch

**"Like NVIDIA Omniverse trains robots in realistic 3D worlds before deployment, we test LLMs in Minecraft with adversarial agents—revealing how they handle conflict, scarcity, and chaos before production."**

### Option 4 (Technical)
**"Multi-agent adversarial testing framework for LLMs. Evaluate cooperation, adaptability, and decision-making in deterministic 3D environments."**
*— 145 characters*

### Option 5 (Punchy)
**"Minecraft stress-tests for LLMs. Adversarial agents, real-time metrics, full observability. Know how your AI breaks before customers do."**

## 30-Second Pitch

"Current LLM benchmarks are black boxes testing happy paths. We put AI in Minecraft with adversarial teammates—agents that refuse to cooperate, hoard resources, and spread confusion.

Every action, chat message, and decision is logged. Our dashboard shows real-time reasoning chains, cooperation scores, and failure patterns.

Think NVIDIA Omniverse for language models. Before you deploy to production, know exactly how your AI handles conflict, scarcity, and chaos.

It's open-source. Works with 400+ models via OpenRouter. Researchers use it to find LLM limits. Companies use it to stress-test before customer deployment."
